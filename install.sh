#A successful installation script will turn a fresh
# installation of raspbian into a functioning
# readykey device

#step 1: install all necessary dependancies, rclone 4.3 maybe in the apt repository under testing

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo bash /home/pi/readykey/depends.sh -y
curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

#step 2: rewrite rc.local to run the program at boot.

#this line is not ideal because it will overwrite any existing rc.local config

# sudo cp  /home/pi/readykey/bin/rc.local /etc/rc.local


# this has not been tested but may append the right lines without ovewriting the config
# could possibly break the gps becasue it does not necessarily take the tttyUSB0 address

#step 4: run the rclone configuration script
#currently must run be configured over vnc or with a display to log in to google drive via a browser
